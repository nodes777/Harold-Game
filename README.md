##APIs, Frameworks and Methods##
* Bootstrap
* MVC
* Canvas
* Prototypical method of object construction
* requestAnimationFrame

##To-Dos##
* Create end game
* Create Bubble Creation
* Background graphics
* Remove Person or Harold Class, they can be the same thing
* Figure out bubble food hierarchy. Why do I need food.render() and bubble.render(); They should fall back to the same thing
* Add music
